//! SAFE core.
//!
//! # Environment Variables
//!
//! The following environment variables can be set to enable custom options. Each one has higher
//! precedence than its respective config file option (see the "Config" section below).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! SAFE_MOCK_UNLIMITED_MUTATIONS
//! ```
//!
//! If set, switch off mutations limit in mock-vault. If `safe_core` is built with
//! `--features=use-mock-routing`, then setting this option will allow an unlimited number of
//! mutations. `safe_core` does not need to be rebuilt for this to take effect.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! SAFE_MOCK_IN_MEMORY_STORAGE
//! ```
//!
//! If set, use memory store instead of file store in mock-vault. If `safe_core` is built with
//! `--features=use-mock-routing`, then setting this option will use mock-vault's memory store,
//! which is faster than reading/writing to disk. `safe_core` does not need to be rebuilt for this
//! to take effect.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! SAFE_MOCK_VAULT_PATH
//! ```
//!
//! If this is set and file storage is being used (`mock_in_memory_storage` is `false`), use this as
//! the path for mock-vault.
//!
//! # Config
//!
//! You can create a config file with custom options following the example in `sample_config/`. The
//! file should be named `<exe>.safe_core.config`. The available options are as follows:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! mock_unlimited_mutations
//! ```
//!
//! If true, switch off mutations limit in mock-vault. If `safe_core` is built with
//! `--features=use-mock-routing`, then setting this option will allow an unlimited number of
//! mutations. `safe_core` does not need to be rebuilt for this to take effect. The default value is
//! false.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! mock_in_memory_storage
//! ```
//!
//! If true, use memory store instead of file store in mock-vault. If `safe_core` is built with
//! `--features=use-mock-routing`, then setting this option will use mock-vault's memory store,
//! which is faster than reading/writing to disk. `safe_core` does not need to be rebuilt for this
//! to take effect. The default value is false.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! mock_vault_path
//! ```
//!
//! If this variable is set and file storage is being used (`mock_in_memory_storage` is `false`),
//! use this as the path for mock-vault.
